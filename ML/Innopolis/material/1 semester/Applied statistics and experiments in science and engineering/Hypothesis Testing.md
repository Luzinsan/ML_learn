Empirical Methods are about identifying empirically laws that govern the (mutual) behavior of entities

We need to shape better the empirical question that we want to address:
- With the GQM, to define with some degree of precision what we want to determine
- Inside the GQM with Hypothesis Testing, to formulate properly the object of study, the focus of our experiment
- With Experimental Design, to properly consider all factors that emerged initally (and partially) while defining the GQM
- With Statistics, to compute the result of testing the hypotheses within the defiinferentialned design of the experiment.

**Descriptive statistics** enables us to present the data in a more meaningful way, which allows simpler interpretation of the data.
**Inferential statistics** are techniques that allow us to use samples to make generalizations about the populations from which the samples were drawn. It is, therefore, important that the sample accurately represents the population.

**Descriptive** statistics state facts and proven outcomes from a population, whereas **inferential** statistics analyze samplings to make predictions about larger populations.
**Population** – set of objects that are studied in a task.
**Sample** – finite set of objects from the population.

> Inferential statistics are statistics which try to infer properties of the population from property of the sample / to make inferences based on samples.

> Null Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis:
> Null Hypothesis means that we don't see an effect and Alternative Hypothesis means that we see an effect.
> Alternative hypothesis is that we want to verify whether it holds or not.

> Alpha level is the level of uncertainty that we're ready to tolerate. It should be chosen arbitrarily based on the importance of the test.
