### Steps in conducting experimental design
1. Define the overall GQM and metrics
2. Decide if an Experiment addresses your research problem
3. Formulate Hypothesis H0 and H1
4. Select a Population and a Sample
5. Select an Experimental Treatment and introduce it
6. Choose a type of the Experimental Design
7. Conduct the Experiment
8. Organize and analyze the data

> The **experimental design** is the general plan for setting up and testing a specific hypothesis or research question.
> Overall, the design directs the *who*, *what*, *when*, and *how* of the research project.
> Selection of the research design is a compromise between the goal of rigorous scientific integrity versus limited resources and reality.
> "Gold standard" trials (*==prospective==*, randomized, blinded, controlled) are the most expensive type of study to perform and often are not the most appropriate to answer certain types of research questions
> Sometimes they aren't even an option for ethical or legal reasons.

# Experiment Design Structure - Schema
- 3 ==research variables==:
	1. *Independent* variable (the intervention)
	2. *Dependent* variable (the outcome)
	3. *Extraneous* variables (other, potentially confounding factors)
- 3 ==design elements==:
	1. *Manipulation* (the ability to influence or direct the **independent** variable)
	2. *Control* (the ability to direct or influence important **extraneous** variables and **study measurements**)
	3. *Randomization* (**unbiased** [random] subject **assignment** to each group)
## Designs
Designs can be:
- *Prospective* - the events of interest haven't yet occurred when the study begins
- *Retrospective* - the events of interest all occurred before the onset of the study
## Taxonomy of Experimental Designs
The most common categorization of experimental designs are:
### **Pre-experimental** designs (**non-experimental**)
- Have one or none of the core experiment design elements
- Lack manipulation and randomization
- May also lack control
- Are generally *retrospective*
- Have the *lowest* scientific validity
#### **The One-Shot Case Study** design
This design involves an expose of a group to a treatment followed by a measure.
 $$\text{Group A: }X \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ O$$
This design have such a total **absence of control** as to be of almost no scientific value.
The inferences are based upon general expectations of what the data would have been had the *X* *(treatment)* not occurred.
This design, if taken in conjunction with the implicit "common-knowledge" comparisons, comprises all of the weaknesses and threads to validity.
**Example**: *We had introduced daily inspections in a team, and after a while collected the statistics on defects rate. Then we compare results against industrial standards.*
#### **One-Group Pretest-Posttest** design
This design includes a *pretest measure* followed by *a treatment* and *a posttest* for a **single group**.
$$\text{Group A:  }O_1\_\_\_X\_\_\_O_2$$
**Example**: *We measured defects rate before (pretest) and after (posttest) introducing of daily inspections (treatment) in a team, and compare results*.
But, this design has a number of potential threats to [[Introduction to Experimental Design#*Internal validity*|internal validity]]:
- *History*. Between $O_1$ and $O_2$ many other change-producing events may have occurred in addition to the experimenter’s $X$. History becomes a more plausible rival explanation of change the longer the $O_1$ − $O_2$ time lapse.
  *Experimental isolation*, if can be achieved, makes this design acceptable for much of scientific researches.
- *Maturation*. Could be biological or psychological processes which systematically vary with the passage of time, independent of
  specific external events.
- *Testing*. The effect of the pretest itself on the experiment. The reactive effect can be expected whenever the testing process is in itself a stimulus to change rather than a passive record of behavior (on therapy for weight control, the initial weigh-in might in itself be a stimulus to weight reduction).
- *Instrumentation*. Autonomous changes in the measuring instrument which might account for an $O_1$ − $O_2$ difference. 
  Where human observers are used to provide $O_1$ and $O_2$ , processes within the observers will contribute to $O_1$ − $O_2$ differences.
- *Statistical regression*. It is about the tautological aspect of the imperfect correlation between $O_1$ and $O_2$  (?).
- The use of *time reversed control analyses* and the direct examination for changes in population variabilities are *useful precautions* against such misinterpretation.

#### **Static-Group Comparison** design

### **True experimental** designs
- Have *all* 3 *design elements*
- Are always prospective
- Have *high* scientific validity
### **Quasi-experimental** designs
- Only have one or two design elements
- Have *manipulation* or *control*
- Generally lack randomization
- Are generally *prospective* in nature
- Are *moderate* in scientific validity
