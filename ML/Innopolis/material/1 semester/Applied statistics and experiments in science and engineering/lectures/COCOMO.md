The Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) is a software cost estimation model that helps predict the effort, cost, and schedule required for a software development project. Developed by Barry Boehm in 1981, COCOMO uses a mathematical formula based on the size of the software project, typically measured in lines of code (LOC).
