#### Why this course:
- to provide a solid foundation for DS and SE efforts for the development of their systems especially with reference to quantitatively: *estimating*, *planning*, *reviewing*, *budgeting*
#### Issues in Data Science:
1. Using the SE practices
2. Major areas: 
	- analyse the efforts of doing the dynamic and sensitive systems
	- collecting the requirements from which follow that the team need often to contact with customer, ... and produce the project as more fast as they can
	- overall architectures for handling the multiple possible solution
	- testing and maintaining 
3. Other structure of organizations - more flexible, agile, effective with predictable and short lifecycles in which the projects come from the outdated SQL-based to no-SQL structures since the last one is need to be accessibility, widespread and intensive data analytics
4. As a result the processes and tools provide the way to effective predict the time for developing, testing systems; the processes are decentralize and agile; tools for predicting mechanism to evaluate the effort and quality
#### Issues in Machine Learning
- ML systems are complex engineering invention which consider the definitions of architectures (CNN, RNN, Fully-connected models, transformers), type of connections (dense, sparse, skip), number of layers and neuron (unit per layer), cost (lost) function, optimization method, etc...
### The questionnaire for SE:
#### Biggest **obstacles** that affect the ability to deliver software
> - Inadequate effort estimation
> - Inefficient usage of working time
> - Wrong prioritization of customer needs
> - Absence of defined software process
> - Late defect detection
> - Poor communication between team members
> - Poor testing process
> - Lack if time for collaboration between team members
> - Ineffective task allocation
####  Sought internal **improvements**
- improving effort estimation (57%)
- But the difficulties in controlling software quality isn't the particularly important thing
> - Effort estimation accuracy
> - Value stream
> - Team collaboration
> - Code coverage
> - Focus on tasks
> - Team productivity
> - Turn around time
#### Planned innovations
> - Unit testing
> - More structures tasks description
> - Pair programming
> - Trace defects
> - Functional points
