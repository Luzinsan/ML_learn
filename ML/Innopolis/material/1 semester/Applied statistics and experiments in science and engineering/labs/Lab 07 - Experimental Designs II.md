## Quasi-experimental designs
- Have [[Experimental Design - part 2#Experiment Design Structure - Schema|manipulation]] or [[Experimental Design - part 2#Experiment Design Structure - Schema|control]]
- Generally lack [[Experimental Design - part 2#Experiment Design Structure - Schema|randomization]] 
- Are generally [[Experimental Design - part 2#Designs|prospective]]  in nature
- Are moderate in scientific validity

> Don't provide full control of potential *extraneous* variables.
> Don't have random assignment usually ethically or logistically just not possible.
> When the researcher lack the full *control* over the scheduling of treatments which makes a true experiment possible.
> Higher *external* validity - they often involve real-world interventions instead of artificial laboratory settings
> Lower *internal* validity than true experimental designs


### Nonequivalent Control Group
- The experimental and the control group are selected without *random assignment*
- Both groups take a pretest and posttest
- Only the experimental group receives the treatment
- Stronger than static-group comparison design due to the pretest

#### Example
- Researchers are interested in whether a causal relationship exists between income and happiness. The income is the independent variable and the happiness is the dependent variable.
- Two groups are selected and on;y one group will obtain an increase in the income. We measure the happiness of participants before and after the increase
