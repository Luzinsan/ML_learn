> **A measurement scale** is a class of mapping that links empirical and number relations with specific properties.  
> Scales are important because they tells us what kind of statistical analysis we can do with the data. (We have to know what type of data we have in order to determine what type of *tests* and *calculations* we can do with that data)

# Qualitative Scales
## Nominal
>Nominal data means that we have categories, which aren't be compared to each other (there's no meaningful way to order arrange or rank them) (ex. gender, occupation, color). Can be calculated *mode* (but nothing more)
## Ordinal
> In ordinal data we can put named categories into meaningful arrangement (we can order or rank them) 
> *(by convention or convenience)*
> (ex.: runners in a race (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)). Distances between categories aren't necessarily equal (that cause we can't calc. mean). It can be calc. the *median*
# Numeric/Continuous Scales
## Interval
> In interval data we have equal distances between points (scores), but we can't use ratios.
> (ex.: temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit). 
> It cannot have a true zero, but it has an arbitrary zero (IQ score, time after the winner in a race)
> Here can be calc. mean, variance, std.
> $$Y=aX+b$$
## Ratio
> Ratio data already has the true zero and then we can calculate ratios (Kelvin, speed of a car)
> $$Y=aX$$
## Absolute
 >Absolute is absolute count, unique absolute count, which we cannot count in any other way.
 $$Y=X$$
