# Introduction to measurements
> ==Measurement== is the process by which numbers or symbols are assigned to attributes of entities in the real world in such a way as to describe them according to clearly defined rules.
> ==Measuring== is the process of attaching values from domain to measurable attributes of an entity.
> We need to restrict based on the context where we are, and based on what we want to achieve.   
> Measurement is a way to give objectivity, to give the feeling of concreteness to the creating of an immaterial entity
> Measurement gives perception of the concreteness and allow us to model the world around us.

> ==Measure== is a product of attaching a numerical value to an attribute of an entity for the purpose of to study relationship between entities that exist.

> Measurement is a map/transformations from our world to a world of numbers, then we can perform operational numbers, and then go back to real world and determine the properties of real world.




>  **Measurement is a map from the empirical world to the formal relational world.
>  Measure is the number of the symbol assigned to the entity by this mapping in order to characterize its anatomy. So the measurement takes us from the real world to the numerical system. 
>  Representational condition is what ensures that the relationships which are true in the empirical world are also true in the mathematical world.**

What it means then to measure? 
Measuring means identifying attributes, selecting attributes, determining numerical relationships which hold between attributes, and then defining the mapping of the sign of the real number, and checking that the numerical relationship are preserved.

### Kinds of measures. 
 
 1st division:
 > A measure is called **objective** if no matter the device we use to take, the result remains the same. 
 > **Subjective** measures are measures which depend on the instrument we use to take, because changing the measurement instrument can change the result. 
 Typically, the most important methods are subjective.
 If we put an objective measure, people will try to optimize the measure, and then don't think anymore of the goal, but we think of the measure.

2nd division:
> Direct measure is a measure which is taken directly from the embryo.
> Indirect is a measure which is a combination, a mathematical combination of other measures.


# Theory of measurement in software

Why metrics related to productivity and quality need to be treated with extreme?
The goodness of a software system is proven over the years. Since software lasts for long, the difference appears over time. 
We can't prove a piece of software correct right now. But the bugs appear over and over and over, and sometimes appear in a spike.


## Representational condition 
The representational condition means that whatever is bigger in the real world must be bigger in the mathematical world. Whatever is smaller in the real world must be smaller in the mathematical world. This is the idea of a mathematical representation.
Making sure that whatever the relationship, which are true in the empirical world, are true also in the mathematical words, and vice versa.
