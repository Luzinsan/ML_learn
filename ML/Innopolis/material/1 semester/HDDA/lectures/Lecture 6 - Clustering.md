> Unsupervised learning 
> - is the broad category that must **find patterns** *in* the data in a principles way in order to determine how **to cluster data** and **generate labels** for predicting and classifying new data; 
> - discover patterns in the data embedded in the low-rank subspaces so that **feature engineering** or **feature extraction** can be used to build an appropriate model.
> - Critical to all of this machine learning architecture is finding low-rank/dimensional feature spaces that are informative and interpretative.

For what? (feature selection and data mining):
- to exploit data for diagnostics, prediction and control, dominant features of the data must be extracted.
- Instead of working with the high-dimensional measurement space, the **features space** allow us to consider a significantly reduces subspace where diagnostics *can be performed*.  

> General ***goal of data mining*** (and machine learning) is to construct and exploit the *intrinsic low-rank feature* space of a given dataset.
> It can be explicitly constructed by expert knowledge and/or correlations among the data
> It can be found in an *unsupervised* fashion by an algorithm.
