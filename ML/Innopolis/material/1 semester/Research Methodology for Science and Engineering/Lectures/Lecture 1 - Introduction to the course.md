The course emphasizes the identification, reduction, and elimination of errors in research, alongside methods for evaluating the validity and reliability of research findings.
### Course Objectives:
The primary objectives of this course are to:
1. **Foster Critical Thinking**: The course is designed to help students become critical consumers of research by abstracting away the technical details and focusing on the underlying principles. It provides tools for understanding the "error model of research," which teaches that research, by its nature, involves inherent errors that researchers must aim to minimize.
2. **Challenge and Review**: Students will learn how to challenge research by searching for potential errors that researchers might have missed. This includes learning to critically appraise research in terms of scientific validity, industrial/practical impact, methodology, data representation, and other key factors.
3. **Comprehensive Learning of Research Evaluation**: The course covers both external and internal criteria for evaluating research. External criteria involve comparing the research findings with what is already known about the topic, checking for agreement with prior work, and determining the coherence of new conclusions with firsthand experiences. Internal criteria involve independent scrutiny of the methodology and findings, which increase the likelihood of research correctness.

### Course Structure:
The course is divided into several key sections:
- **Theory of Research**: Introduces students to the fundamental principles of research in computer science.
- **Research Domains and Experience**: Focuses on various areas of research and the practical challenges faced by researchers.
- **Student Presentations**: Includes several key deliverables:
  1. **Proposal Presentation (Week 5)**: Students will present a proposal based on their area of interest.
  2. **Literature Review (Week 8-9)**: A detailed review of at least five research papers related to their topic.
  3. **Group Work**: Students will collaborate on a group project that involves evaluating three research papers.
  4. **Final Presentation (Week 14-15)**: A critical appraisal of one paper, where students present its strengths and weaknesses.

The grading for the course is distributed as follows:
- **Proposal Presentation**: 10 points
- **Literature Review**: 35 points
- **Reviewer Role (for LR)**: 10 points
- **Group Work**: 20 points
- **Final Presentation**: 25 points

### Research Paper Evaluation:
The course teaches students to read and evaluate research papers through multiple readings, enabling them to understand the research thoroughly. Students are expected to:
- **Summarize and analyze**: Read the selected papers multiple times to develop an in-depth understanding.
- **Contextualize**: Compare the paperâ€™s content with the state-of-the-art research in the field.
- **Evaluate Validity**: Use evaluation criteria such as correctness, novelty, research utility, scope, and funding.
- **Critical Appraisal**: Produce a short literature review and a concise critical appraisal, focusing on what the paper lacks, the validity of its conclusions, and how it could be improved.
- **Present Findings**: Present their analysis, identifying pros, cons, and areas for improvement in a final presentation.

### Types of Computing Research:
The course also explores various types of research methods commonly used in computing, including:
1. **Mathematical Proofs**: Understanding abstract proofs, like the famous P=NP problem.
2. **Experimental Methods**: Reviewing experiments and how improper research designs can lead to incorrect conclusions (e.g., the 1966 experiment by Grant and Sackman on developer productivity).
3. **Simulations**: Analyzing models like traffic flow simulations, which are used to test theories in controlled environments.
4. **Building Systems**: Developing new systems, such as the early Cray computers, that serve as research tools.
5. **Creating Tools and Methods**: Innovating new methodologies for computing research.

### Sources of Information:
Students are guided on how to choose research papers from reputable sources, including online journals and databases. The FIFO (First In, First Out) method is encouraged for selecting papers.

### Producers and Consumers of Research:
The course distinguishes between the various stakeholders in research production and consumption:
- **Producers**: These include universities, government institutions, and industries conducting research.
- **Consumers**: These encompass teaching universities, industries applying research, governments, and the general public. A key challenge is the effective **transfer of technology** from research to practical applications.

### Funding Sources:
The course briefly touches on the importance of research funding, identifying major funding bodies such as the **Russian Science Foundation (RSF)**, **European Space Agency (ESA)**, **EU infrastructural programs**, and **NASA**, among others.

### Quality of Research:
The quality of research is measured by several factors, including:
- **Duration and Longevity**: How long the research remains relevant.
- **Novelty**: Whether the research presents new findings or approaches.
- **Practical and Research Utility**: The practical impact of the research and its utility in further research.
- **Correctness and Scope**: How accurate the findings are and the breadth of their application.

### Conclusion:
This course provides a robust framework for understanding, evaluating, and presenting research. It emphasizes the importance of critical thinking, thorough analysis, and the scientific method. By the end of the course, students are expected to not only consume research knowledge but also contribute to their fields through careful evaluation and scholarly presentations. The curriculum prepares students for a research-oriented career by focusing on evaluation, methodology, and clear communication of scientific findings.
